/**
Event can be locked, unlocked or passed, depending on several conditions:
- several EventCondition (only one needs to be valid), which themselves can consist of several constraints (that all need to be valid)
- previous choices that locked/unlocked the Event
If those 2 conditions are present (EventCondition and Choices), BOTH needs to be valid to unlock the Event.

To model this, there is 2 status, one global and one specific to the choices ("unlockedByChoice"). The rational behind this
second status is that we need to be able to know if the event has been unlocked by a choice or not, and we cannot track this
with only one status.
Example:
1. Event1 is locked by default, and have 1 EventCondition1 attached to it, as well as one previous choice (choice1) that can unlock it.
2. Choice1 is not executed. It thus does not unlock the Event1, also because EventCondition1 is still not valid.
3. Another event is played, and the consequences make EventCondition1 to be valid.
4. EventCondition1 is now valid, but the Event1 should still be locked as Choice1 has never been executed.!--
With only one global state, the above cannot be modeled properly, as we would have "forgotten" that Choice1 was never executed.
